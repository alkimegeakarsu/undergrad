# Computer Vision Fundamentals
In this project, I explored fundamental concepts that make the CV field what it is today.

### Summary
- Erosion and dilation operations
- Calculating image histograms
- Histogram equalization
- Thresholding using Otsu's method (grayscale -> B&W)
- Opening and closing operations
- Counting objects in an image
- Convolution with Sobel and Prewitt operators
