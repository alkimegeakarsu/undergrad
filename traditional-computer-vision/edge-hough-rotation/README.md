# Edge Detection, Hough Transform, Rotated Image Matching
In this project, I explored more advanced algorithms that emphasize the structure in an image.

### Summary
- Canny edge detection
- Straight line fitting using probabilistic Hough Transform
- Calculation of line orientation histograms
- Using line orientation histograms to match rotated images
