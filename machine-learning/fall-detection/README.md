# Fall Detection
In this project, I used SVM and neural network algorithms to classify fall vs no fall events.

### Summary
- 2D visualization using PCA, outlier detection
- K-means clustering
- Training and test set preperation
- 10-fold cross validation to optimize hyperparameters on SVM and neural network (grid search)
- Test set performance of best models
