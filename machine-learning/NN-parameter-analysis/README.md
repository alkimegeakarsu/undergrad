# Neural Network Parameter, Hyper-parameter Analysis
In this project, first, I implemented the artificail neural network algorithm without using any ML libraries, 
then, I experimented on the parameters and the hyper-parameters of the model to see how the changes effect the learning behavior

### Summary
- Loading dataset and labels
- Dataset standardization
- Experimentation on learning rate, number of hidden units etc.
