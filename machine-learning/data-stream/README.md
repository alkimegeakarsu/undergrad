# Data Streams: Concept Drift and Adverserial Attacks
In this project, I compared many algorithms with my custom algorithm on their
ability to detect and recover from concept drift and adverserial attacks in the 
context of data streams.

### Summary
- Exploration of 4 sample synthetic datasets
- Building a custom ensamble classifier from scratch
- Performance comparison of custom classifier with inbuilt classifiers in detection of concept drift
- Performance comparison of custom classifier with inbuilt classifiers in detection of adverserial attacks
