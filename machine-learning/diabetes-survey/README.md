# NN vs KNN vs LR Performance in Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis from Survey Data
In this project, first, I implemented feedforward neural network, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression 
algorithms without using any machine learning libraries. Then I compared the performance of these models on the 
diabetes health indicators survey dataset.

### Summary
- Loading dataset and labels
- Dataset standardization
- Correlation analysis
- Hyperparameter optimization (cross validation and hold out set)
