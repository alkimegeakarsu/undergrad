# Monkey Classification
In this project, I constructed a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch,
trained it using various optimizers and compared it to using a pretrained model and transfer learning.

### Summary
- Data loader
- Normalization of monkey images
- Construction of custom CNNs
- Training and testing with SGD and Adam optimizers
- Training and testing with pretrained model
- Conclusion
