- PCA (Implemented without using any ML libraries)
    - Principal component extraction
    - Explained variance calculation
    - Displaying PCs as images
    - Image compression using PCA
- Hyperparameter optimization for LR and SVM
    - Learning rate
    - C value
    - ...
- LR (Implemented without using any ML libraries)
    - Train and test full-batch gradient descent
    - Train and test mini-batch gradient descent
- SVM
    - Train and test linear kernel
    - Train and test polynomial kernel
- Cross validation
- Conclusion
