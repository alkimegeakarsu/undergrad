# Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization
In this project, I experimented with dimensionality reduction 
and data visualization methods.

## Summary
- Principal components, proportion of variance explained, and visual representation of each principal component.
- Classification performance with different number of PCs.
- Isomap projections and classification performance with different parameter values.
- t-SNE projections and classification performance with different parameter values.
