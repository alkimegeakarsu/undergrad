# Audio Amplifier
In this project, we used transistors and OPAMPs to design, simulate, and implement an
audio amplifier using a custom PCB.

### Summary
- Audio amplifier design with OPAMP gain stage and transistor power stage.
- User adjustable gain.
- Simulated with LTSpice.
- Implemented with custom PCB.
- 3.5mm jack input and outputs.
