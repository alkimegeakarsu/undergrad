# Spoken Number Recognition
In this project, we used a Basys 3 FPGA development board, an ADC, 
a custom microphone amp PCB, and MATLAB to create a system that 
recognizes the number spoken to the microphone. FPGA code is written
in VHDL.

### Responsibilities
- Custom microphone ciruit and PCB design and implementation
  - Electret mic
  - 2 stage amplifier (voltage and power)
  - Anti aliasing filter
  - OPAMPs
  - Simulation in LTSpice
  - PCB design in EasyEDA
- Mel filter bank design and implementation in VHDL
- Discrete cosine transform energy calculation in MATLAB
- Comparison of reference and recorded cosine transforms and number decision
