# Robot Vacuum Platform
In this project, I used the components listed below to create a robot that 
detects and avoids obstacles and cliffs with user adjustable obstacle avoidance distance.
FPGA code is written in VHDL.

## Components
- Basys 3 FPGA development board
- Wheeled robot chasis
- 2 DC motors with wheels
- DC motor driver board
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- 2 Infrared distance sensors
- Breadboard
- Batteries
